- 👋 Hi, I’m @Arsanias

- 👀 I’m interested in languages, bodybuilding and playing music instruments but my biggest passion is chinese astrology. 

- 🌱 I’m mainly developing in Embarcadero Delphi but currently I am learning C++, C# and Java.

- 💞️ I’m not looking for collaboration but I like to share, to support others to make a step forward.

- 📫 You can reach me by mail arsaniasbb@gmail.com
